# **PKMNHub**
*A Pokémon gameplay companion platform*

PKMNHub is a personal full-stack development project built to deepen experience with scalable backend design, AI workflow integration, and TypeScript ecosystem. This in-progress full-stack application is designed to centralize useful tools for Pokémon players including team building, breeding calculator, Pokéwalker step tracking, and Pokédex management. The platform uses a AI-powered insights to support personalized decision-making.

## 🏗 **Software Design & Architecture**

### **Backend**
- Next.js App Router for server-side API routing
- Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL for relational data modeling and querying
- Service layer using OOP Delegate pattern
- Middleware authentication with JWT + bcrypt hashing
- Controllers for clean separation of concerns
- LangChain + LangGraph + Groq for AI workflow execution

### **Frontend**
- Next.js + React
- React Query for data fetching & caching
- Client-side hooks for API interaction

### **Database**
- PostgreSQL with normalized schema for many-to-many relationships
- Dataset imported from CSV and transformed for complete local control from: https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi/tree/master
- Entity Relationship Model (version 19-11-25):

## 🧪 **Testing**
| Tool | Purpose |
|-------|----------|
| Postman | API validation and collection testing |
| Playwright | UI and E2E test automation |

---

## 💡 **Planned AI Capabilities**
- Team-building recommendations based on each game
- Type & move coverage analysis
- Breeding optimization suggestions
- Natural-language Pokémon knowledge search
